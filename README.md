# HELP!

A friend of yours is getting married, but the site they used to track their wedding plans went out of business.

The failed startup was kind enough to send them a data dump, but it's in a crazy nested hash in a ruby file.

They've asked you to help them decipher the data, and answer some questions.

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repo
1. Look at the data in `people.rb`
1. Check out `00_example.rb` for an example of what to do (basically, just `puts` things out
  1. Import the tracker stories in stories.csv and work through them.
  1. Rejoice!

  ## Further Practice

  This warmup can be completed multiple times to increase your comfort level with the material.
  To work on this from scratch, you can:

  1. Add an upstream remote that points to the original repo `git remote add upstream git@github.com:gSchool/hash-1.0.git`
  1. Fetch the latest from the upstream remote using `git fetch upstream`
  1. Create a new branch from the master branch of the upstream remote `git checkout -b v2 upstream/master`
  1. Implement specs and code
  1. Push using `git push -u origin v2`

  Each time you do the exercise, create a new branch. For example the 3rd time you do the exercise the branch
  name will be v3 instead of v2.
